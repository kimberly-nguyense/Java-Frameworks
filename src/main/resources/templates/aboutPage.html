                <p class="text-primary-emphasis m-5">When we first started, we had no idea our home cafe would turn into a community cafe and then into Remi's Cafe. At the start of Covid, we could not
                    indulge in our local cafes and bakeries. This led to the beginning of our little home cafe. A freshly brewed espresso to perfection. As the Covid quarantine
                    restrictions lifted, we began to invite friends and family to enjoy a cup of coffee. Friends of friends and family began to show interest, so we decided to
                    host small gatherings to meet new people with a mutual interest in home cafes. Unable to keep up with the demand for each event, we opened Remi's Cafe.
                    It was scary to dive into foreign territory, as we knew nothing about running a business. Through a lot of trial and error, our cafe was able to grow
                    into what it is today. We have our community to thank for supporting us through it all and allowing us incorporate creativity in our cafe menu.</p>
